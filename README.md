# Course URL Repository ðŸ“š
This repository contains a [structured dataset of URLs](https://github.com/statlib/youtube-course-playlists/blob/main/courses.json) corresponding to a curated selection of technical courses available on YouTube, sourced directly from their playlists. The URLs were extracted using [this script](https://github.com/statlib/youtube-course-playlists/blob/main/extract_urls.js).
The primary purpose of this collection is to provide a centralized and structured dataset of course links.
This can be useful for several purposes, e.g. for web scraping.
